                <li><strong><kbd>1983</kbd></strong> Born on 22 February, in France</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2004</kbd>-<kbd>2006</kbd></strong>  Created Portraits of a Generation, portraits of young people from the housing projects around Paris that he exhibited in huge format. This illegal project became official when the City of Paris put JRâ€™s photos up on buildings.</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2007</kbd></strong> With Marco, JR put up enormous photos of Israelis and Palestinians <i><b>Face to Face</b></i> in eight Palestinian and Israeli cities on either side of the Separation Barrier. Upon his return to Paris, he pasted these portraits up in the capital.</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2008</kbd></strong> Undertook an international tour for <i><b>Women Are Heroes</b></i>, a project in which he highlights the dignity of women who are often targets during conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2011</kbd></strong> Won the TED Prize for 2011. He used the $100,000 award money to start the <i><b>Inside Out</b></i> Project, a global art initiative that has allowed thousands of people around the world to speak to their communities through portraits pasted in public space. This prize brought him and his work to New York City where he opened another studio, and inspired pastings in the area such as those done in 2011 of members of the Lakota Native American Tribe from North Dakota.</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2013</kbd></strong> Started project the <i><b>Wrinkles of the City</b></i>. As of 2015, this project has reached Shanghai, China, Los Angeles, California, Havana, Cuba, Berlin, Germany and Istanbul, Turkey.</li>  
                <li><strong><kbd>2014</kbd></strong> Collaborated with the New York City Ballet for their second annual Art Series program, by exhibiting work in the theatre in Lincoln Center, including an interactive piece on the floor of the promenade. This collaboration led JR to explore the artistic medium of choreography in another project with the ballet months later.</li>
                <li><strong><kbd>2015</kbd></strong> Made the movie <i><b>Les Bosquets</b></i> inspired by the riots in the French suburbs in 2005 and featuring the performance of the ballet Les Bosquets of New York City Ballet (2014). The same year, he directed the short film titled <b><i>Ellis</i></b>, starring Robert De Niro.</li>
